# 🧩 **Processes and Threads**

> “The OS illusion: making one CPU act like it’s 20.”

---

## 💡 Big Idea

Every running program isn’t _just code_ — it’s a **process**,  
an isolated world with its own memory, resources, and identity.

The OS juggles hundreds of these, switching between them so smoothly you think it’s multitasking.

---

## 🧠 Process: The Living Program

A **process** is a running instance of a program with:

- Its own memory space
- CPU time slices
- Open files / I O handles
- Unique process ID (PID)

**Analogy:**  
A person at a desk, working with their own supplies, taking turns at the CPU coffee machine.

---

## ⚙️ Process Lifecycle

**States**

- 🆕 **New** – being created
- 🟢 **Ready** – waiting for CPU
- 🔵 **Running** – currently executing
- 🟡 **Waiting** – blocked for I/O or event
- 🔴 **Terminated** – finished or killed

**Transitions:** scheduler decisions, I/O events, system calls.

---

## 📈 Visual Model

```

New → Ready → Running → Terminated
↘ Waiting ↗

```

Each arrow represents a system call or interrupt that changes who holds the CPU.

---

## 🧩 Threads: The Mini-Processes

A **thread** is a lightweight process inside another process.

All threads share:
• Memory space
• Code / data sections
• File descriptors

Each thread has:
• Own stack
• Own program counter
• Own schedule

## 🎭 Process vs Thread Comparison

| Feature       | Process        | Thread               |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Memory space  | Separate       | Shared               |
| Communication | Slow (IPC)     | Fast (shared vars)   |
| Overhead      | High           | Low                  |
| Isolation     | Strong         | Weak                 |
| Typical use   | Whole programs | Tasks inside program |

---

## 🧠 Why Threads Exist

- To do multiple tasks within one program (browser tabs)
- To overlap computation with I/O
- To scale across multiple cores
- To confuse CS students since 1970

---

## 🧩 Context Switching

When the CPU switches threads/processes:

1. Save current CPU state (registers, PC, etc.)
2. Load next thread’s state
3. Resume execution

**Overhead:** switching too often wastes cycles — scheduling aims to minimize that.

---

## 🧠 Scheduling Overview (Concept Only)

Schedulers decide:

- Who runs next
- For how long (quantum)
- When to pre-empt

Common strategies:

- **FCFS** – First Come, First Served
- **RR** – Round Robin
- **SJF** – Shortest Job First

---

## 🧩 System Calls — The OS Entry Points

Processes interact with the OS via **system calls**:
`fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`, `read()`, `write()` …

They’re the controlled bridge from **user mode → kernel mode**.

---

## 🧠 Process Creation (UNIX Style)

```bash
pid = fork()
if pid == 0:
    exec("child_program")
else:
    wait(pid)
```

- `fork()` duplicates the process
- `exec()` replaces it with new code
- `wait()` synchronizes parent and child

---

## 🧩 Visualization Idea – “Process Zoo”

Simulate multiple processes competing for CPU:

- Random burst and I/O wait times
- Log state transitions
- Scheduler: Round Robin for fairness

Shows the lifecycle in motion instead of static theory.

---

## 🧩 Why It Matters

Understanding processes and threads explains:

- Multitasking
- Deadlocks (next week)
- Virtual memory
- Containers and virtualization

Every higher-level abstraction depends on these primitives.

---

## 🎯 Exit Prompt

Finish the sentence:

> “A thread is like a \_**\_ because it \_\_**.”

Examples

- “ …like a roommate — shares space but has its own schedule.”
- “ …like a worker bee — independent but part of one hive.”

| Concept        | Core Idea                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Process        | Running program with own resources |
| Thread         | Lightweight execution unit         |
| Scheduler      | Decides who runs next              |
| System Call    | Bridge to kernel operations        |
| Context Switch | Save/restore between tasks         |
